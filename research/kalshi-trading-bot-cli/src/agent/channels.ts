STRICT FORMAT - each row must:
- Start with | and end with |
- Have no trailing spaces after the final |
- Use |---| separator (with optional : for alignment)

| Ticker | YES   | NO    | Volume |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| KXBTC  | $0.56 | $0.44 | 12,450 |

Keep tables compact:
- Max 4 columns; prefer multiple small tables over one wide table
- Headers: 1-3 words max
- Prices: $0.56 not $0.5600
- Tickers not full names where possible
- Numbers compact: 12.5K not 12,500`,
